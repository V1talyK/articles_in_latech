In the oil industry, there is a noticeable trend towards using proxy models to simulate various levels of complexity in order to make operational predictions. In particular, machine learning techniques are being actively developed in the context of the digitalization and automation of production processes.
This paper proposes a method for combining a physically relevant fluid flow model with machine learning techniques to address the challenges of history-matching and prediction. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic oil reservoir models. 
The synthetic model has significant zonal inhomogeneities in the permeability and storativity fields.
The simplified single-phase flow through a porous medium model was used for the proposed approach. This model was matched to the historical values of the development parameters by restoring the fields of the reservoir parameters. Properties fields were reconstructed using a radial basis functions network and a fully connected linear layer.
Based on the reconstructed field, interwell connectivity coefficients were calculated, which corresponded qualitatively and quantitatively to the true interwell connectivity coefficients. The predictive characteristics of the proposed approach were evaluated by split the historical dataset into training and test time intervals.

\section{Introduction}
Currently, in the oil industry, in addition to the use of traditional hydrodynamic models, the use of simplified proxy models has become widespread. This use of simplified modeling reduces computational costs and also reduces the requirements for the quality and completeness of source data. The development and application of proxy modeling in inverse and optimization problems are relevant, as these are the most resource-intensive tasks. In addition to physically-based models, such as material balance \cite{mus1}, super elements, CRM \cite{bek}, streamlines \cite{pot} and  multi-phase flow models \cite{ele}, \cite{kos}, approaches based on machine learning techniques are also being investigated  \cite{tem}, \cite{uma}. However, the use of machine learning-based techniques alone as predictive models cannot guarantee that the results will be precise from a physical aspect. The combined use of physically-based models and machine learning techniques avoids these kinds of problems \cite{kos2}. The goal of this research is to develop proxy models that are based on the theory of fluid flow through porous medium and machine learning principles. 

The figure \ref{fig:schime1} illustrates the general approach used in this work. The algorithm combines machine learning techniques (ML) with a physical model of single-phase fluid flow (Flow), which acts as one of the components in a "hybrid" neural network architecture. According to the algorithm, some of data from the "Input ML" is transmitted as input data to the machine learning module. The output values from the machine learning process are then calculated and combined with the remaining data from the "input Flow" to act as the input for the "Flow" calculations. The result of solving the adjoint problem are the values of the gradients for the fluid flow process, which are used to configure the parameters in a machine learning model. Gradient calculations for the machine learning components are performed using the standard backpropagation error method. For the single-phase flow model, the gradient calculation is a separate and time-consuming process with a computational complexity that is typically comparable to or greater than that of direct calculations. The gradient calculation for the single-phase model is performed in a separate block during the solution of the conjugate problem.

The purpose of this research is to develop proxy models based on the theory of fluid flow through porous media and machine-learning techniques. The goal is to estimate hydroconductivity and storativity parameters for reservoir systems in interwell spaces. This has been achieved using a fluid-flow model and known reservoir pressures at specific flow rates in the wells. To control predictive accuracy, the simulated production period was divided into a training interval and a test interval.

\section{Mathematical Model}

\subsection{Single-phase flow model}
To solve this problem, a two-dimensional mathematical model of single-phase flow of a
weakly compressible fluid was used as a fluid flow model \cite{bas}:

\begin{equation} \label{fil}
	\triangledown \cdot \left[\frac{k}{\mu}\triangledown P \right] = \beta^* \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \delta(x_1,x_2),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{bc}
	\delta(x_1,x_2)  = \left\{\begin{array}{crl}
		0, \;\mbox{if}\;(x_1,x_2) \notin\ \Gamma_{in}\cup\Gamma_{out},\\
		q_{i}, \;\mbox{if}\;(x_1,x_2) \in \Gamma_{in},\\
		q_{a}, \;\mbox{if}\;(x_1,x_2) \in \Gamma_{out},
	\end{array}\right. 
\end{equation}
Closing ratios:
\begin{equation} \label{kr}
	P = P_0\mbox{,\quad \mbox{if} $t=0$},
\end{equation}
where $k$ is permeability, $P$ is reservoir pressure, $\beta^*$ is
effective compressibility, $q_i$ is fluid flow rate in $i$-th well, $\Gamma_{in}$
is set of coordinates of sources/drain (wells), $\Gamma_{out}$ is
outer boundary, $P_0$ is reservoir pressure at the initial time $t=0$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are coordinates, $q_{a}$ is specific fluid flow rate through the outer boundary, which can be written as:
\begin{equation*} \label{qaq}
	q_a = T_{a}(P_{a} - P|_{\Gamma_{out}}),
\end{equation*}
where $P_a$ is on the aquifer ($P_a = P_0$), $T_a$ is
aquifer boundary transmissibility (includes aquifer productivity factor). The goal of the inverse problem is to find the reservior permeability $k = k(x_1,x_2)$ and effective compressibility $\beta^* = \beta^*(x_1,x_2)$ at which the calculated values of reservoir pressure and water flow rate on the wells will satisfactorily coincide with the initial values.

\subsection{Radial basis functions network}

Obtaining the values of $k(x_1,x_2)$ and $\beta^*(x_1,x_2)$ can be done in various ways. For example, by interpolating and extrapolating measured values near the wells within the well space. This article suggests using a machine learning model to obtain the desired values. A two-layer neural network, consisting of a radial basis function (RBF) layer and a fully connected (linear) layer, was chosen as the machine learning model. The RBF layer determines the influence of each basis at a selected point in space.

When solving the inverse problem, it is more convenient to switch from permeability $k$ to general mobility $\lambda$ \cite{abd}. Using this parameter, it is possible to consider many hydraulic parameters that affect the flow structure (such as viscosity, relative phase permeability, and others). Instead of effective compressibility $\beta^*$, it is more convenient to switch to the storativity parameter $\beta$, which allows a complete assessment of elastic-capacitive characteristics. The fields of general mobility $\lambda$ and storativity $\beta$ can be considered as functional dependences of $\lambda(\mathbf{x})$ and $\beta(\mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{x} = (x_1,x_2)$ is a vector of spatial coordinates, and a network of radially basis functions is used for the dependency.

\begin{eqnarray}\label{rbf}
	f_i(\mathbf{x}) = exp \left(\frac{-\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{c_f}_i \rVert^2}{\epsilon_{fi}^2}\right), \quad
	g_i(\mathbf{x}) = exp \left(\frac{-\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{c_g}_i \rVert^2}{\epsilon_{gi}^2}\right),
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\lambda(\mathbf{x}) = w_{fi}f_i + b_h, \quad
	\beta(\mathbf{x}) = w_{gi}g_i + b_g,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mathbf{x}$ are the coordinates of the calculated nodes, $\mathbf{c_f}_i$ and $\mathbf{c_g}_i$ are the position of the bases, $\epsilon_{fi}$ and $\epsilon_{gi}$ are the width of the bases, $w_{fi}$ and $w_{gi}$ are the weights of the bases, $b_f$ and $b_g$ are the free term. The parameters of the network of radial basis functions $\mathbf{c}_i$, $\epsilon_i$, $w_i$, $b$ are adjusted during the matching of the single-phase flow model.

\subsection{Inverse problem}


The inverse problem can be solved using an optimization approach that involves minimizing the objective function $J$.
The objective function can be expressed as the sum of terms, each term being the product of a function that characterizes the deviation of the calculated values from the target values, and a corresponding weighting factor. Standard error was used as a measure of deviation (MSE):
\begin{equation} \label{mse}
	J=\frac{w_p}{N_p}\sum_{i=1}^{N_p}{\left(p_c^i-p_f^i\right)^2}+
	\frac{w_{\lambda}}{N_\lambda}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\lambda}{\left(\Delta\lambda^i  \right)^2}+
	\frac{w_{\beta}}{N_\beta}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\beta}{\left(\Delta\beta^i  \right)^2},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{mse1}
	\Delta\lambda^i  = \left\{\begin{array}{crl}
		\lambda^i_c - \lambda^i_r, \quad \;\mbox{if}\; \lambda^i_c \ge \lambda^i_r\\
		0,\quad \;\mbox{if}\; \lambda^i_l < \lambda^i_c < \lambda^i_r\\
		\lambda^i_c - \lambda^i_l, \quad \;\mbox{if}\;\lambda^i_c \le \lambda^i_l
	\end{array}\right.,
	\quad
	\Delta\beta^i  = \left\{\begin{array}{crl}
		\beta^i_c - \beta^i_r, \quad \;\mbox{if}\; \beta^i \ge \beta^i_r\\
		0,\quad \;\mbox{if}\; \beta^i_l < \beta^i_c < \beta^i_r\\
		\beta^i_c - \beta^i_l, \quad \;\mbox{if}\;\beta^i_c \le \beta^i_l,
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}	
where $p_c^i$ is the calculated value of reservoir pressure, $p_f^i$
is the true value, $i$ is the measurement number, $N_p$ is the
number of reservoir pressure measurements,$N_\lambda$ is the
number of known mobility values and $N_\beta$ is the number of known values of storativity, $\lambda$ is the true value of mobility near the welll, $\lambda_c$ is the calculated value of mobility, $\lambda_l$ and $\lambda_r$ are the left and right restrictions on the value of total mobility, $\beta$ is the true value of the storativity near the well. $\beta_c$ is the estimated value of elasticity, $\beta_{l}$ and $\beta_{r}$ represent the left and right limits on the elasticity range. The index $f$ is actual values (fact), and $c$ means calculated, $w_p$, $w_\lambda$ and $w_\beta$ are weighting coefficients that take into account the degree of influence of various parameters (dimension, data quality, etc.). The arguments of the objective function responsible for pressure, are the true (measured) and calculated values of reservoir pressure at the location of the well at specified points in time.

The second and third terms in the objective function ({\ref{mse}})--({\ref{mse1}}) are responsible for adjusting the mobility field and storativity to match known values of the reservoir's hydraulic-capacitive properties. Furthermore, the calculated values for mobility and storativity may vary within a range from $\lambda_l$ to $\lambda_r$ and from $\beta_l$ to $\beta_r$. However, this does not lead to an increase in the objective function, as long as the interval is acceptable. The presence of this interval is linked to changes over time in the phase ratio of liquid produced from wells and its effect on the values of mobility and storativity near the wells.

For using gradient optimization method, it is necessary to calculate the gradient components of the objective function. These can be written as follows:
\begin{equation*}\label{grad}
	\frac{\partial J}{\partial u_k} = 
	2w_p\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N	({p_c^i-p_f^i}) \frac{\partial p_c^i}{\partial u_k}+
	2w_{\lambda}\frac{1}{N_\lambda}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\lambda}{\Delta\lambda^i}\frac{\partial
		\lambda_{c}^i}{\partial u_k}+
	2w_{\beta}\frac{1}{N_\beta}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\beta}{\Delta\beta^i}\frac{\partial
		\beta_{c}^i}{\partial u_k}.
\end{equation*}
The optimization problem is solved when each component of the gradient of the objective function tends to 0, which can be written as:
\begin{equation} \label{rp}
	\frac{\partial J}{\partial u_k} \rightarrow 0.
\end{equation}

In order to solve the inverse problem using the gradient descent method, it is necessary to calculate the components of the gradient vector of the objective function, using configurable parameters. Parameters RBF (\ref{rbf}) can be used as these configurable parameters. Components of the gradient vector:

\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial J}{\partial w},\quad \frac{\partial J}{\partial \epsilon},\quad \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}, \quad \frac{\partial J}{\partial \mathbf{c}}.
\end{equation*}

Additional terms can be added to the target function (\ref{mse}), which are penalty functions that allow for regularization of the resulting solutions. A new term was added, which allows  to control the position of the basis functions (\ref{rbf}) relative to each other and the computational domain. If the basis functions are located close to each other or extend beyond the boundaries of the computational area, an additional penalty will be added to the target function.

\begin{equation} \label{pnl}
	J_{pnl}=\frac{2w_{dist}}{N_\textbf{x}*(N_\textbf{x}-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\textbf{x}}{\sum_{j=i+1 }^{N_\textbf{x}}{\left(f_{relu}\left(r_{min} - r_{i,j}\right)\right)^2}} + 
	\frac{w_{bnd}}{N_\textbf{x}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_\textbf{x}}{\left(f_{relu}\left(r_{i,c} - \frac{L}{2}\right)\right)^2},
\end{equation}
where $w_{dist}$ and $w_{dist}$ are the weight coefficients for penalty functions in terms of the distance between the bases and the position relative to the boundaries of the calculated area, $N_\textbf{x}$ is the number of bases, $r_{i,j}$ is the distance between the $i$th and $j$th $r_{min}$ is the minimum allowable distance between the bases, $r_{i,c}$ is the distance from the i-th basis to the center of the calculated area, $f_{relu}$ is the activation function (rectified linear unit).

Gradients are computed using the standard machine learning technique of error backpropagation, which in this instance involves solving a conjugate problem for the single-phase flow model  \cite{kos3}, \cite{far}. This is done by solving for the derivative of the objective function with respect to physical parameters such as mobility and storativity $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \beta}$. These derivatives are then used to calculate the gradients of the objective function, which are then passed to the machine learning algorithm. The Flux library \cite{inn}, written in the Julia programming language, was used to implement the presented approach, which allows for the calculation of gradients in a straightforward manner.


The solution of the inverse problem (\ref{rp}) is found  numerically
by the iterative method. At each iteration, the direct problem
(\ref{fil})--(\ref{kr}) is numerically solved and the derivatives of
the objective function are calculated according to the adjustable
parameters of the model. The numerical solution was found
by the control volume method for a two-dimensional rectangular
difference grid using the IMPES method \cite{azi}.

The objective function ({\ref{mse}}) used to solve the inverse problem is not always suitable for a subjective assessment of the accuracy of the model. Accuracy of the history-matching process was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This metric enables us to estimate the model's ability to accurately reproduce actual reservoir pressure, mobility values, and storativity at wells.


\section{Results}

The proposed approach was tested using a synthetic model of an oil reservoir measuring 1000 x 1000 meters and 9 wells, including 5 producing wells (P1-P5) and 4 injection wells (I1-I4). The model includes highly conductive inclusions with permeability $k_1 = 200*10^{-15} \text{m}^2$ and $k_2 = 100*10^{-15} \text{m}^2$, in the main part of the region permeability is $k = 20*10^{-15} \text{m}^2$. Wells I3, I4 and P5 are located in an area where the storativity is increased by 2 times.

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/fig2.eps}
	\caption{Schematic representation of the computational domain}
	\label{fig:schime}
\end{figure}

To solve the inverse problem, the fluid flow rates from the producing and injection wells obtained as a result of direct numerical modeling were used as operating modes. The porosity, formation thickness, and initial and boundary conditions corresponded to those in the direct problem.
The inverse problem is solved using an optimization formulation in which the objective function is minimized. This is achieved by summing the functions (\ref{mse}) and (\ref{pnl}).
The solution of the problem was obtained under conditions of possible absence of a complete set of data on reservoir pressure.
In practice, only a limited number of pressure values are usually known, which rarely exceed 10-20\%. The results of pressure calculations, obtained as a result of solving a direct problem, are used as actual measurements of reservoir pressure by only 10\% of their total amount. The values were chosen randomly, and they serve as true values to solve the inverse problem.

The simulation period lasted 10 years, during which time the wells operated according to the specified modes. The calculation step was 1 month. The time dependence of the injection rate for the wells, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:inj_rate}, was obtained by random sampling and has a piecewise-constant form. Injection wells also shut down at a predetermined frequency. The downtime period ranged from 2 to 4 months. 
The time series show production from the wells Fig. \ref{fig:prod_rate}, was generated by randomly sampling values and has a piecewise-constant structure. The start of production wells was carried out in 3-month increments.
The resulting dataset was used to solve the inverse problem. In order to assess the predictive capabilities of the model, the data was divided into training and testing sets. The first seven years of development history were allocated to the training dataset and used to matching the model. The seven- to ten-year period was included in the test set for which forecasting calculations were carried out.

\end{figure}

The initial reservoir pressure was set to $20 \text{MPa}$. At the boundaries of the development area, a constant reservoir pressure of $20 \text{MPa}$ was maintained. The parameters of the rock and fluid were as follows: porosity = $0.2$, absolute permeability, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:schime}, effective viscosity = $1 \text{mPa*s}$, layer thickness = $4 \text{m}$, effective elastic capacity = $10^{-4} \text{MPa}^{-1}$.

The optimization problem was solved using the optimization algorithms included in the Flux package (Descent and ADAM). As a result, permeability maps Fig. \ref{fig:mob}a and maps of storativity Fig. \ref{fig:comp}b were obtained.
From the figures, it can be seen that the restored fields qualitatively reproduce the original ones \ref{fig:schime}, although they have visual differences.

\end{figure}

In the figures Fig. \ref{fig:mob}a and \ref{fig:comp}b black crosses indicate the obtained node positions for the network of radial basis functions. It can be seen that they are unevenly distributed, with a significant number of nodes concentrated in the highly permeable region $k_1$ and slightly less in the region $k_2$. In addition, a significant part of the nodes are located in an area with increased elasticity, although with a lower density.
As a result of the solution, the algorithm selects the position of the nodes in such a way as to best reproduce the main characteristics of the zonal heterogeneity.

A quantitative comparison was made between the true and estimated fields of general mobility based on interwell connectivity. A comparison of the relationships between interwell connections is presented in Table \ref{tabl:connection}. These values were obtained by partly excluding variables from a numerical single-phase flow model \cite{and}. High values for compounds I1-P1 and I4-P3 correspond to high-permeability zones (channels). This indicates that the ranking order of the estimated values is similar to the order of true values. Additionally, there is a reasonable level of agreement between the values of interwell connection with an average absolute error of 6\%. Therefore, the estimated general mobility field adequately represents the key characteristics of the original field.

The value of the connection between wells is often not reliably known in real oil reservoirs. These values can be obtained by using paired hydraulic well monitoring, but such studies are rarely conducted. In view of this, one of the main criteria for evaluating the quality of the model is the correspondence between estimated and true reservoir pressure. In Fig. \ref{fig:cp}, the comparison of true and estimated pressure values for wells is shown. The estimated pressure values were obtained for a model with restored permeability and storativity fields. Different markers indicate the values of training (train) and testing (test) samples in the figure, hollow and filled circles resperctively. A satisfactory match was achieved for the training and testing samples, with average relative errors of 2.6\% and 3.5\% respectively. The model shows satisfactory accuracy in the testing sample, which confirms its predictive capabilities.

A quantitative comparison of the true and estimated values of storativity is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:hist}. In the figure, columns 1 and 2 correspond to the true and estimated values, respectively. The values were obtained by averaging the values obtained from the map and included in the corresponding Voronoi polygon for the corresponding well. As can be seen from the figure, the algorithm was able to reproduce the increased storativity in the corresponding zones (wells I3, I4, and P5). Despite the differences in the values of average storativity, a qualitative correspondence between the true and the estimated values was achieved.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

The paper presents an approach to the joint use of the theory of fluid flow through a porous medium with machine learning to solve the problem of comparing the model with historical data. Using the example of a synthetic model of an oil field element with regionally heterogeneous fields of permeability and storativity, the implementation of this approach is demonstrated.

The matching of the single-phase flow model to historical data was achieved by reconstructing the permeability and storativity fields using a network of radial basis functions and a fully connected linear layer. Based on the reconstructed permeability field, interwell connectivity coefficients were calculated that quantitatively correspond to the true value. Using the storativity field, an averaging method calculates average values for the storativity indicators near the wells. These average values also qualitatively correspond with the initial values. Therefore, the proposed approach allows the restoration of the characteristic appearance of zone heterogeneity in a simulated object.

The solution to the inverse problem was obtained for the case where there was a significant number of missing data points in the original dataset. This makes the proposed method suitable for practical application.This algorithm has a universal nature, suggesting the possibility of using more complex machine learning algorithms in future applications.
